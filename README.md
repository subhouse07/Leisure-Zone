# Leisure Zone

This is a simple website that was done for a school project. It consists of a home page, a registration page and a confirmation page that is shown upon successful registration. The site is currently set up to use PHP to validate the input fields, but there is also code in the regvalidate.js file for javascript validation (from an older version). That's about all that is going on with this one!
